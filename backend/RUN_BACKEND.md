# To run the FastAPI backend from the project root, use this command:
#
#   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
#
# This ensures that the 'backend' package is discoverable and all imports work correctly.
#
# If you want to run from the backend folder, set the PYTHONPATH first:
#
#   $env:PYTHONPATH="C:\Users\Suriya\OneDrive\Desktop\Deployly"
#   uvicorn main:app --reload
#
# For Windows PowerShell users.
